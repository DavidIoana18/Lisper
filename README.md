## Lisper

Is a client-side website that uses the [Secrets API](https://secrets-api.appbrewery.com/) in order to reveal the deepest, darkest secrets of people anonymously. It is inspired by a real app called Whisper.

## Technologies Used:
- Express framework for the backend
- Axios: to make HTTP requests to an external API and to get a random secret and pass it to index.ejs to display the secret and the username of the secret
- EJS: as the templating engine to render HTML pages dynamically
